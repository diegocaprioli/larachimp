# Basic Usage

The Larachimp package can be used to perform any Mailchimp API v3 request, as it's accepted by the API. By simply using the `LarachimpFacade` you can make any request that the Mailchimp API accepts, for example:

```php
$response = LarachimpFacade::request('GET', 'lists/01a4f2ac6m', [
    'query' => ['fields' => 'id,web_id,name'],
]);
```

This `request()` method returns the JSON decoded response of the request made. The response is generated by calling the PHP's [json_decode()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php) method.

This is it's simplest usage mode. It allows to communicate in a simple and complete way with Mailchimp.

Any request made will be automatically logged into the Laravel log, specifying the API Request made and the API Response received.

You can also directly call these convinience methods instead of `request()`:
* `LarachimpFacade::get($resource, $options);`
* `LarachimpFacade::post($resource, $options);`
* `LarachimpFacade::patch($resource, $options);`
* `LarachimpFacade::put($resource, $options);`
* `LarachimpFacade::delete($resource, $options);`
